WHY BOTH SSH AND HTTPS EXIST
GitHub allows two authentication methods:

🔵 1. SSH = Key-based authentication
✔ No password
 ✔ No token
 ✔ Stronger security
 ✔ Faster
 ✔ Once configured, never asks for login again
 ✔ Best for developers working daily in terminal
SSH uses:
git@github.com:username/repo.git

This matches your current working setup.

🟢 2. HTTPS = Token-based authentication
✔ Requires Personal Access Token (PAT)
 ✔ Works everywhere (even office networks, schools, companies)
 ✔ Easy for beginners
 ✔ Works without generating SSH keys
HTTPS uses:
https://github.com/username/repo.git


⭐ THEN WHY HAVE BOTH IF PUSH IS SAME?
Because different situations need different methods.

📝 Reason 1 — Many companies block SSH
Some offices block port 22, which SSH needs.
 HTTPS (port 443) always works.
So corporate developers MUST use HTTPS.

📝 Reason 2 — Cloning public repos works anonymously via HTTPS
You can:
git clone https://github.com/.../repo.git

No login needed.

📝 Reason 3 — SSH is convenient for heavy developers
Daily contributors prefer SSH because:
Never asks password/token


More secure


Works better for automation



📝 Reason 4 — Some tools or scripts need HTTPS
CI/CD pipelines, servers, or cloud services often only support HTTPS tokens.

⭐ Summary in One Line
HTTPS is simple & universal. SSH is secure & convenient.
 Both are allowed so that developers can choose what fits their environment.

⭐ Which one should you use?
Since you already set up SSH successfully:
✔ Use SSH for daily work (push/pull)
Super easy. No password required.
✔ Use HTTPS only if:
SSH port is blocked


You want to use token-based access


Some system requires it


__________________________________________________________________



✅ 1. Install Git (on Windows)
Download Git for Windows:
 https://git-scm.com/download/win
 Install with default settings.
(WSL Ubuntu already includes Git, but Windows Git is also useful.)

✅ 2. Check Git in WSL
Open Ubuntu (WSL) and run:
git --version

If needed:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y


✅ 3. Set your Git identity
Use the SAME email as GitHub:
git config --global user.name "Shubham"
git config --global user.email "shubhamdudhbhate2006@gmail.com"

Check:
git config --list


🔥 IMPORTANT: DELETE WRONG SSH KEYS BEFORE CONTINUING
You accidentally created a wrong key file (“Shubham”), so let’s clean the folder.
Run:
rm -rf ~/.ssh
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

Now the folder is empty and clean.

⚡ NOW WE START THE CORRECT SSH SETUP

✅ 4. Create a NEW SSH key (correct method)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "shubhamdudhbhate2006@gmail.com"

When it asks:
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/shubham/.ssh/id_ed25519):

👉 PRESS ENTER (do NOT type anything)
When it asks for passphrase → press ENTER two times.

✅ 5. Start SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"


✅ 6. Add your private key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


✅ 7. Get PUBLIC key to add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Copy the FULL line starting with:
ssh-ed25519 AAAA...


✅ 8. Add key to GitHub
Go to:
GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG Keys → New SSH Key
Title: WSL Ubuntu


Key: (paste the key)


Key type: Authentication Key


Save



✅ 9. Test the connection
ssh -T git@github.com

Correct output:
Hi ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

This means → WORKING 100%

cd /mnt/c/Users/Shubham/Desktop/OST


🚀 NOW YOU ARE READY TO USE GIT
Examples:
Create a repo:
mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init

Add files:
git add .

Commit:
git commit -m "first commit"

Add remote:
git remote add origin git@github.com:ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI/myrepo.git

Push:
git push -u origin main



mkdir myproject
cd myproject
git init



3. Connect this folder to GitHub repo
git remote remove origin


Copy the SSH URL from GitHub repo:
git@github.com:YourUsername/myproject.git
git@github.com:ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI/OST.git


Add remote:
git remote add origin git@github.com:YourUsername/myproject.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI/OST.git




UserName: ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI

Password : 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


Check:
git remote -v





git branch -m main


ls
echo "OST projects" > README.md
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main






__________________________________________________________________________________________




__________________________________________________________________________________________


FORKING WORKFLOW (VERY CLEAR VERSION)
Use this when you want to contribute to someone else’s repository.

⭐ STEP 1 — Fork the Repo on GitHub
Open the original GitHub repo


Click Fork


Now the repo appears in your account:


github.com/YourUsername/ForkedRepo


⭐ STEP 2 — Clone YOUR fork (not the original)
If using SSH:
git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/ForkedRepo.git
cd ForkedRepo

Or HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ForkedRepo.git
cd ForkedRepo


⭐ STEP 3 — Add the ORIGINAL repo as “upstream”
git remote add upstream git@github.com:OriginalUser/OriginalRepo.git

Check:
git remote -v

You should see:
origin    --> your fork
upstream  --> original repo

✔ origin = your fork
 ✔ upstream = original repo

⭐ STEP 4 — Create a Branch for Your Work
Never work on main.
 Always create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature-branch


⭐ STEP 5 — Make Changes and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"


⭐ STEP 6 — Push Branch to YOUR Fork
git push -u origin feature-branch


⭐ STEP 7 — Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to:
github.com/YourUsername/ForkedRepo

You will see:
Compare & Pull Request

Click → Write description → Submit PR.

⭐ STEP 8 — KEEP YOUR FORK UPDATED
When the original repo gets new updates, sync them to your fork.
Step A: Fetch original repo updates
git fetch upstream

Step B: Update your main branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

OR easier:
git pull upstream main

Step C: Push updated main to your GitHub fork
git push origin main

____________________________________________________________________


CLEAR SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT COMMANDS
LOCAL
git init       → start repo on your PC
git add .      → stage files on your PC
git commit     → save on your PC
git push       → send from PC → GitHub (remote)

REMOTE
git remote add origin <url>  → link PC repo → GitHub repo
git remote add upstream <url>→ link PC repo → original repo (in forking)
git remote -v                → show GitHub connections
git remote set-url origin    → change GitHub link


Branching
git branch
git checkout -b new-branch
git checkout main
git merge new-branch

Updating your fork
git pull upstream main


WHAT IS A MERGE CONFLICT?
A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically merge changes because:
two people changed the same line


or one edited a file while the other deleted it


or commits overlap



✅ GENERAL PROCESS TO SOLVE ANY CONFLICT
Git warns you about a conflict
Open the conflicted file → you will see:


<<<<<<< HEAD
(your changes)
=======
(their changes)
>>>>>>> branch-name

Decide what to keep:


your version


their version


combine both


manually edit


Remove the conflict markers:
 <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>


Save the file


Run:


git add <file>
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
git push



















HTTPS

✅ STEP 1 — Check HTTPS Remote
To see current URL:
git remote -v

If you see SSH like:
git@github.com:ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI/OST.git

→ That’s SSH.
To switch to HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI/OST.git

Done.

✅ STEP 2 — Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)
PAT replaces your password.
Go to GitHub:
⚙️ Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
 Choose:
Fine-grained token (recommended)
Permissions needed:
✔ Contents → Read and Write
 ✔ Pull Requests → Read and Write
 ✔ Metadata → Read
Generate → Copy the token.
 (You cannot see it again later.)

❗ IMPORTANT
When Git asks:
Username for 'https://github.com':

You enter:
Your GitHub username (ShubhamDudhbhate)

Then it asks:
Password for “”

You MUST paste your PAT (token)
 NOT your GitHub password.

✅ STEP 3 — Test push using HTTPS
git push -u origin main

It will ask:
✔ Username → your GitHub username
 ✔ Password → your PAT token
If correct → push works.

🌟 AFTER YOU LOGIN ONCE
Git will remember your PAT using Windows Credential Manager.
You won’t need to enter it again.

⭐ SUMMARY OF HTTPS SETUP COMMANDS
Set HTTPS remote:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo.git

Clone using HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo.git

Push using HTTPS:
git push -u origin main

Git will ask for username + PAT.



METHOD 1 — Use Credential Manager (BEST for Windows)
Git can save your token permanently using:
Run this in WSL:
git config --global credential.helper manager-core

This uses Git Credential Manager (GCM) which securely stores your PAT in Windows Credential Manager.
Now push:
git push -u origin main

It will ask:
✔ Username → your GitHub username
 ✔ Password → your PAT token
Then GCM stores it forever.
 Next time → no password asked.

 IF YOU PREVIOUSLY UNSET CREDENTIALS
Run this to clean old settings:
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --system --unset credential.helper 2>/dev/null
git config --local --unset credential.helper 2>/dev/null

Then set again:
git config --global credential.helper manager-core

_________________________________________________________________________






Summery:

✅ 1. SIMILARITIES (commands that are 100% SAME)
Whether you use SSH or HTTPS, the following commands NEVER change:
✔ Git Basics (same)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "msg"
git status
git log

✔ Branch commands (same)
git branch
git checkout -b feature
git checkout main
git merge feature

✔ Local operations (same)
Everything done inside your PC is 100% same for SSH & HTTPS.

🚀 2. PUSH / PULL commands (same)
git push
git push -u origin main
git pull
git fetch

Even here — SSH or HTTPS makes NO difference.

🔥 3. WHAT IS DIFFERENT? Only ONE thing: the remote URL
SSH remote URL looks like:
git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS remote URL looks like:
https://github.com/Username/Repo.git

That’s the ONLY difference in commands.

🔥 4. COMMANDS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
A) Add remote
SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/Repo.git

B) Change remote
SSH:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Username/Repo.git

C) Authentication required?
SSH:
 ✔️ No password
 ✔️ No token
 ✔️ Never asks again
HTTPS:
 ❌ Cannot use password
 ✔️ Must use Personal Access Token (PAT)
 🔁 If no credential helper → asks again

🧠 5. Authentication difference (VERY IMPORTANT)
SSH Login Test
ssh -T git@github.com

If SSH keys are set → login works.
HTTPS Login Uses PAT
git push

Then it asks:
Username (GitHub username)


Password → use PAT, not GitHub password



🧩 6. When cloning — difference
SSH:
git clone git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/Username/Repo.git

FORKING WORKFLOW (VERY CLEAR VERSION)
Use this when you want to contribute to someone else’s repository.

⭐ STEP 1 — Fork the Repo on GitHub
Open the original GitHub repo


Click Fork


Now the repo appears in your account:


github.com/YourUsername/ForkedRepo


⭐ STEP 2 — Clone YOUR fork (not the original)
If using SSH:
git clone git@github.com:YourUsername/ForkedRepo.git
cd ForkedRepo

Or HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ForkedRepo.git
cd ForkedRepo


⭐ STEP 3 — Add the ORIGINAL repo as “upstream”
git remote add upstream git@github.com:OriginalUser/OriginalRepo.git

Check:
git remote -v

You should see:
origin    --> your fork
upstream  --> original repo

✔ origin = your fork
 ✔ upstream = original repo

⭐ STEP 4 — Create a Branch for Your Work
Never work on main.
 Always create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature-branch


⭐ STEP 5 — Make Changes and Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"


⭐ STEP 6 — Push Branch to YOUR Fork
git push -u origin feature-branch


⭐ STEP 7 — Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to:
github.com/YourUsername/ForkedRepo

You will see:
Compare & Pull Request

Click → Write description → Submit PR.

⭐ STEP 8 — KEEP YOUR FORK UPDATED
When the original repo gets new updates, sync them to your fork.
Step A: Fetch original repo updates
git fetch upstream

Step B: Update your main branch
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

OR easier:
git pull upstream main

Step C: Push updated main to your GitHub fork
git push origin main

CLEAR SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT COMMANDS
LOCAL
git init       → start repo on your PC
git add .      → stage files on your PC
git commit     → save on your PC
git push       → send from PC → GitHub (remote)

REMOTE
git remote add origin <url>  → link PC repo → GitHub repo
git remote add upstream <url>→ link PC repo → original repo (in forking)
git remote -v                → show GitHub connections
git remote set-url origin    → change GitHub link


Branching
git branch
git checkout -b new-branch
git checkout main
git merge new-branch

Updating your fork
git pull upstream main


WHAT IS A MERGE CONFLICT?
A merge conflict happens when Git cannot automatically merge changes because:
two people changed the same line


or one edited a file while the other deleted it


or commits overlap



✅ GENERAL PROCESS TO SOLVE ANY CONFLICT
Git warns you about a conflict
Open the conflicted file → you will see:


<<<<<<< HEAD
(your changes)
=======
(their changes)
>>>>>>> branch-name

Decide what to keep:


your version


their version


combine both


manually edit


Remove the conflict markers:
 <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>


Save the file


Run:


git add <file>
git commit -m "Resolved conflict"
git push



















HTTPS

✅ STEP 1 — Check HTTPS Remote
To see current URL:
git remote -v

If you see SSH like:
git@github.com:ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI/OST.git

→ That’s SSH.
To switch to HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ShubhamDudhbhate-VJTI/OST.git

Done.

✅ STEP 2 — Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)
PAT replaces your password.
Go to GitHub:
⚙️ Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
 Choose:
Fine-grained token (recommended)
Permissions needed:
✔ Contents → Read and Write
 ✔ Pull Requests → Read and Write
 ✔ Metadata → Read
Generate → Copy the token.
 (You cannot see it again later.)

❗ IMPORTANT
When Git asks:
Username for 'https://github.com':

You enter:
Your GitHub username (ShubhamDudhbhate)

Then it asks:
Password for “”

You MUST paste your PAT (token)
 NOT your GitHub password.

✅ STEP 3 — Test push using HTTPS
git push -u origin main

It will ask:
✔ Username → your GitHub username
 ✔ Password → your PAT token
If correct → push works.

🌟 AFTER YOU LOGIN ONCE
Git will remember your PAT using Windows Credential Manager.
You won’t need to enter it again.

⭐ SUMMARY OF HTTPS SETUP COMMANDS
Set HTTPS remote:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo.git

Clone using HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/YourUser/YourRepo.git

Push using HTTPS:
git push -u origin main

Git will ask for username + PAT.



METHOD 1 — Use Credential Manager (BEST for Windows)
Git can save your token permanently using:
Run this in WSL:
git config --global credential.helper manager-core

This uses Git Credential Manager (GCM) which securely stores your PAT in Windows Credential Manager.
Now push:
git push -u origin main

It will ask:
✔ Username → your GitHub username
 ✔ Password → your PAT token
Then GCM stores it forever.
 Next time → no password asked.

 IF YOU PREVIOUSLY UNSET CREDENTIALS
Run this to clean old settings:
git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --system --unset credential.helper 2>/dev/null
git config --local --unset credential.helper 2>/dev/null

Then set again:
git config --global credential.helper manager-core

Summery:

✅ 1. SIMILARITIES (commands that are 100% SAME)
Whether you use SSH or HTTPS, the following commands NEVER change:
✔ Git Basics (same)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "msg"
git status
git log

✔ Branch commands (same)
git branch
git checkout -b feature
git checkout main
git merge feature

✔ Local operations (same)
Everything done inside your PC is 100% same for SSH & HTTPS.

🚀 2. PUSH / PULL commands (same)
git push
git push -u origin main
git pull
git fetch

Even here — SSH or HTTPS makes NO difference.

🔥 3. WHAT IS DIFFERENT? Only ONE thing: the remote URL
SSH remote URL looks like:
git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS remote URL looks like:
https://github.com/Username/Repo.git

That’s the ONLY difference in commands.

🔥 4. COMMANDS THAT ARE DIFFERENT
A) Add remote
SSH:
git remote add origin git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS:
git remote add origin https://github.com/Username/Repo.git

B) Change remote
SSH:
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Username/Repo.git

C) Authentication required?
SSH:
 ✔️ No password
 ✔️ No token
 ✔️ Never asks again
HTTPS:
 ❌ Cannot use password
 ✔️ Must use Personal Access Token (PAT)
 🔁 If no credential helper → asks again

🧠 5. Authentication difference (VERY IMPORTANT)
SSH Login Test
ssh -T git@github.com

If SSH keys are set → login works.
HTTPS Login Uses PAT
git push

Then it asks:
Username (GitHub username)


Password → use PAT, not GitHub password



🧩 6. When cloning — difference
SSH:
git clone git@github.com:Username/Repo.git

HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/Username/Repo.git
